app.js -->main start point for the backend code to start..
          it sets up the entire blockchain enviornment for us

config --->has configuration settings and links for bluemix

config1 --->has a normal template type of struct

functions-->has main business logic for node webservices
            each function would return a valid output and the export it to blockchain_sdk.js

routes.js --->it has post and get methods and the name of the endpoints where a developer has to hit..
              and then once the service is called the post or get method would jump to functions/xyz.js (where it would execute the logic)
              and pass the response back.    

src --->has js files related to node sdk..every file here is modular and doesnt need much modifications as it just validates 
the inputs received creates a log file and changes are only expected in blockchain_sdk.js

blockchain_sdk.js --->this would expect an input from required functions..and the validate it and pass it to chaincode.
